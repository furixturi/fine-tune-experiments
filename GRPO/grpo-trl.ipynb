    "We want to find a person’s age in 1988, where their age equals the sum of the digits of their birth year. Let’s break this apart. Let the birth year be Y, and the sum of its digits be S(Y). The equation becomes: 1988 - Y = S(Y), or Y + S(Y) = 1988.\n",

    "We’ll assume Y is a four-digit number, so Y = 19ab, where ‘a’ and ‘b’ are digits. Therefore, S(Y) = 10 + a + b. This gives us:\n",
    "1900 + 10a + b + (10 + a + b) = 1988. Let’s solve for a and b.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the puzzle: Let the birth year be Y = 1900 + 10a + b. The sum of digits of Y is S(Y) = 10 + a + b. The equation becomes 1910 + 11a + 2b = 1988, and so 11a + 2b = 78. Solving this, I find that a = 6 and b = 6. Therefore, the birth year is 1966. In 1988, their age is 22, which matches the sum of the digits. So, the person was 22 years old in 1988.\n",
